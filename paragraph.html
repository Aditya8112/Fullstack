<b>I believe my strength is my attitude.</b> <br> 
My strength is that I am always ready to take up new challenges and strive for excellence. <br> 
This is because I believe success and failures are the best way to sculpt ourselves to reach our goals.<br> 
And I believe in myself and my hard work.<br>

<u>My short-term goal is to achieve excellence in the skills I'm mastering. <br> 
However, my long-term goal is to be a software engineer in an organization and reach the highest level of success. </u><br> 
My moral is never to intend to harm anyone on purpose.
